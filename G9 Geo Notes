**Unit 1: Introduction to Canadian Geography (Chapter 1, pgs.4-16)** 


Steps to geographic inquiry 
find a problem
gather information
analyze information
form conclusions
communicate conclusions


Absolute location: 
The location of an object in absolute coordinates (longitude and latitude)


Relative location: 
The location of an object in relation to another.


Geotechnologies: 
The use of advanced technology in the study of geography and in everyday use.


GPS(Global Positioning System)
A satellite-based system that provides location data using triangulation


GIS(Geographic information System) 
A system that analyzes and manages geographic information, can be used to analyze data.

Remote Sensing – their purpose, how they work,	
Is to see or measure something from a satellite. It works by using radar waves to capture images, then adding color onto it afterwards.


Geographic concepts: 


interrelationships: Identifying the relationships that exist within and between natural and human environments. Seeing how things affect each other.


spatial significance: The importance of a particular location in geography; to answer “what is where?”, and “why there?” “why care?”


patterns & trends: To look for patterns and/or trends in geographic data. 


geographic perspective: Different ways to look at 1 geographic problem, to consider those multiple perspectives.


FNMI knowledge and perspective (TEK)
The indigenous people have a close connection and respect for this land as they:
Hunted and only took what they needed
Were nomadic people and travelled the land
Respected the power of nature
Lived in the land for centuries








**Unit 2: Interactions in the Physical Environment (Chapters 1-4, pgs.18-100)**


Theory of Continental Drift: What is it? continents used to be part of a supercontinent called Pangea


Pieces of evidence: similar mountains in 2 continents, same fossils, fitting like a puzzle, ice in india


Four geologic eras - Cenozoic, Mesozoic, Paleozoic, Precambrian


Theory of Plate Tectonics: large slabs of rock controlled by the flow of magma in a circular motion known as convection.


Type of plate movements:
convergent: when multiple plates collide
divergent: when multiple plates pull away from each other
transform: when plates overlap each other


Major Forces: 
folding and faulting: tectonic activity that forms mountains.


volcanism: tectonic activity that spews magma out of a volcano, resulting in magma rocks on land and small islands in water.


glaciation:
depositional effects: small rocks in the glacier scrape and burrow in the ground and then melt into the area. An example is a lake and a moraine.
erosional effects: when glaciers scrape away at the surface of the land and pick up rocks, slowly eroding them.

weathering, erosion – rounding the tops of mountains.


Types of rock and how they form (rock cycle)
any rock melts into magma
magma cools into igneous rock,
any rock breaks down into sedimentary rock
any rock is put under high heat and pressure into metamorphic rock



Landform regions: name and where located in Canada, descriptive features
Copy of Landform Regions of Canada.Part1.2021 Copy of Landform Regions of Canada.Part2.2021
Terms: climate and weather 


Climate graph: graphing, analysis (temperature range, growing season)


Continental vs. maritime climate


Global Climate Change: causes & effects (in Canada and globally) & solutions 


Greenhouse gases, examples: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide.


Soil: wet-climate (leaching) and dry-climate (calcification) -explain fully & provide location in Canada
Dry Climate(calcification)
Dry soil
Nutrients rise up to the top layer
when very dry, soil becomes infertile
Top soil is rich
populates area with less rain and farmers have to add more water to their crops(irrigation).
Wet Climate(leeched)
Wet soil
Nutrients get washed down and away
Poor quaility soil

There are 4 types of soil in canada 
Tundra Soil
Wet-Climate Soil(dominates most of country)
Dry-Climate Soil
Mountainous Soil

Vegetation Regions:
Region	
Tundra, Only a few very small trees grow here
- Small plants
- Harsh conditions
Boreal and Taiga Forest, One of the largest forest region in the world
Growing season gets longer farther South
- Long and Cold winters
- Deciduous trees (White birch, Poplar)
- Poor quaility soil
Grassland, Too dry for tree growth
- Some trees
- Natural grasses grow taller in wetter areas
Mixed Forest, Mainly Deciduous
- A bit of Boreal in the Northern area
- Winters are cool and summers are warm
- Soils are not as rich in the South, but more fertile than the Boreal Forest
- Much of the South Mixed Forest has been cleared for agriculture
Deciduous Forest, Canada's Tiny Deciduous forest region
- Hot summers and relatively mild winters
- Cleared for farming
- Soils are fertile
West Coast Forest, Large Coniferous species
- So much Precipitation that it is called a temperate rainforest

Deciduous	
- The trees that drop their leaves during the winter to survive
- Found in tropical climates	
- Oak trees
- Maple trees
- Hickory trees
Coniferous	
- The trees that do not drop their leaves during the winter
- Found in rather cooler climates	
- Cedar trees
- Douglas-fir trees
- Fir trees



LOWERN
Latitude
The closer you are to the equator, the temperature gets warmer(tropic climate)
The further you are away from the equator, the colder it will be. (temperate climate)
Canada is far from the equator, therefore it has cooler weather.
The reason why it is hottest at the equator is that the sun’s rays are concentrated at the equator. The rays are spread over a small area. 
The sun’s rays are spread out from the equator and lose some of their intensity.) Therefore at somewhere like Canada have a cooler climate
Ocean Currents
Ocean currents moving away from the equator is relatively warmer than the surrounding water.
Water currents moving towards the equator is cooler. 
Winds moving across an ocean are warmed or colled by the temperature of the ocean. The wind brings that temperature to the land masses around it. 
Therefore, places affected by a warm current are warmer (Prince Rupert) and places that are affected by a cold current are colder (Cartwright)
IN Canada, B.C benefits from a warm current(North Pacific Current) resulting in milder winters/summers.
IN Canada, East Coast (NF, PEI, etc) is affected by two currents(Labrador Current)
super cold current
really foggy.
Wind and Air Masses
Wind: when air moves from high pressure to low pressure.
Air mass: large volume of air that takes on the climatic conditions of the area in which it forms.
air mass over ocean contains moist air and brings precipitation.
air mass far from ocean has dry air, no precipitation.
Air masses move depending on weather patterns.
air masses affect local climates. air moves over from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. moving air is wind.
wind belts: created when air rises high into atmosphere above low-pressure zones into high-pressure zones.
When a hot air mass and a cold air mass collide, fog
When à VERY HOT air mass and VERY COLD air mass collide, results in a THUNDERSTORM or SNOWSTORM.
high pressure air mass = clear skies, sunny
low pressure air mass = cloudy
Elevation
On earth, the higher you go the colder it is.
At higher elevation, there is less air sitting on top of the air, so there is less pressure.
Air rises and pressure decreases. It results in air expanding as it cools

Expansion without condensation makes the air cool by 1 degree celsius for every 100 metres of elevation change, because there is less air for the Sun’s radiation to heat.

Cooler air cannot hold moisture, so condensation happens. The condensation gives off heat so the rate of cooling drops to 0.6 degrees celsius for every 100 metres of elevation change.
Relief
Relief: The shape of the surface of the land.

relief is a type of precipitation that happens near a mountain.
Windward: facing the wind, get more rain and snow. Wet.
Leeward: not facing the wind, less rain and snow. Dry place, rainshadow.
Near Water
One of the most important climate factors is closeness to water. 
Places that are close to an ocean have what is called a maritime climate. Winters are mild, and summers don’t get too hot. Therefore, the annual temperature range is quite small (less than 25 degrees celsius). Precipitation is high in a maritime climate, usually exceeding 1000 mm a year.

Places that are further from an ocean have what is called a continental climate. Land heats and cools much more quickly, so temperatures are more extreme. HOT SUMMERS AND COLD WINTERS. Annual temperatures typically exceed 25 degrees celsius. No nearby water masses are there though, so annual precipitation is less than 1000mm per year. 
The places around the great lakes  should be continental, but because they are so big, they provide a partial maritime influence. Those areas are called modified continental. They somewhat moderate the climate and provide a source of moisture.





**Unit 3: Managing Canada’s Resources and Industries (Chapters 5-9, pgs.101-201)**


Chapter 4: Rethinking How We View and Use Natural Resources: p. 83-85
-Natural Resources:  renewable vs. non-renewable resources, flow resources (with examples) - p. 85 

renewable resources : Something, that if used properly, could be reused or brought back to the original form after care. Trees, fish, wheat
Non- renewable resources : Things you take from the environment that you can’t bring back to its original form (or takes extremely long to) . Uranium, fossil fuels.

Flow Resources: Something that continuously happens that doesn’t stop, part of the environment. Wind, Water, Solar energy

Chapter 5:  Managing Renewable Resources Successfully (Fishing, Farming and Forestry) p. 101-123
Fishing; p.104-105, p.118-123, video worksheets
-Fishing methods: trawling, long-lining, tournara (description, advantages, disadvantages)


Trawling
A large net is pulled across the seafloor by 2 steel barrels.
Very easy to catch the fish(profitable) Automatic, efficient, Labor free
Destroys ecosystems, Indiscriminate.Tons of bi-catch.


Long-Line
A very long line, extending for miles with tongs of baited hooks.
Gets a lot of fish,Efficient,Labor free, Takes a bit longer
Indiscriminate, Bi-catch


Tournnara
Large and intricate net(cage like) Forces Bluefin Tuna into the trap and kills them.
Less bi-catch
Lots of labor, Less profit(less fish)


-Overfishing: 


Causes: (better tech) Larger nets, Freezers on the boat, SONAR, RADAR GPS,Dynamite,Cyanide


Consequences: Disrupting the food chain , and also the extinction of species(fish), loss of food supply(protein). Finally, loss of jobs.


Solutions: Chefs using sustainable fish, Seafood Choices Alliance, Aquaculture(breeding fish artificially),
Put strict quotas(limit fishermen to a certain number of fish), Marine Parks(areas in the ocean where fish cannot be caught.

5 Reasons why the East Coast fisheries collapsed?
Overfishing, Improved Fishing Technologies, Uncontrolled Foreign Fishing, Destructive Fishing Practices, Changes in natural conditions.

Differences between:  inshore vs. offshore fishing 
Inshore fishing: close to land, lower yields, traditional.
Offshore fishing: Far from land, higher yields, modern.

-What is aquaculture? Aquaculture is basically fish farming.

-Types of fish and examples: groundfish, pelagic, shellfish
Groundfish: Fish that are caught near the ocean floor (Cod, Haddock, Halibut.)
Pelagic fish: Fish that are caught near the surface (Salmon, Herring, Mackerel, Tuna, Capelin)
Shellfish: Animals without backbones but with hard, protective shells.(Shrimp, lobster, oysters, scallops, mussels.)
	
Agriculture p.103, p.106-109
-Extensive vs. intensive farming (characteristics)
Intensive:
Involves relatively small areas of land
Requires large amounts of labor
They are located near large urban areas and produces products such as dairy products for the nearby large population

Extensive: 
Involves large areas of land
Requires relatively small amounts of labor
Produces products such as wheat and cooking oil for export

-Issues with the farming industry: factory farming, loss of farmland, BSE (mad cow), GMOs, organic farming, sustainable agriculture, decline of family farmers, rise of agribusiness.

-Characteristics of sustainable farming (notes)
-largely owned and run by independent family farms
-goals is to use no hormones and antibiotics 
-seeks to balance the need for profit and the health of environment and animals
-animals are raised outside over large acres of land
-cows eat grass

Forestry p.104, p.112-115
-3 ways to cut down trees: clear-cutting, selective cutting, shelterwood

Clear Cutting: 
Used in the vast majority of forest operations, because it is fastest and cheapest.
Removes EVERY TREE.
used to cut pine, spruce, fir, aspen, and poplar.
When the trees are replanted, they are organized to make it easier for them to be cut again.
If trees aren’t replanted, the soil will erode and the land may be damaged

Shelterwood:
clear-cutting only a fraction of a forest. trees that have seeds are not cut so that their seeds can regenerate the logged area. 
This is only used for strong tree species such as white pine, where they regenerate naturally after major openings in the forest are created.

Selective Cutting: 
Only harvesting trees that are of perfect size, shape, maturity, and quality. 
Less disruptive to the forest environment.
used in forests where tree species need shade to become established. hardwoods, like sugar maple, are cut in this manner.

Costly process because of the extra time and care taken to cut down the trees.
Does not allow the process of replanting a new, uniform forest.

Chapter 6:  Freshwater—Canada’s Special Resource?  p. 125-141
-How much freshwater is there in the world (salt vs. freshwater %’s) -p. 127
3%, but only 1% of that is accessible. Of that, 68% are in ice and snow, 32% groundwater, and 0.03% lakes and rivers.
-Water crisis (Grassy Narrows, Attawapiskat) 
Northwest Ontario, mercury poisoning. Contaminated lake, contaminated fish.

-Difference between water: stores and flows 

Water stores are places in the world where the water is stored(oceans, ice sheets, groundwater)


Water flows are ways that water moves from one store to another, how water goes through the water cycle.(precipitation, evaporation, rivers)

Grand Canal Project -p. 136-137
the Great Recycling and Northern Development Canal.
Water management proposal designed to alleviate North American freshwater shortage problems.


The industry that uses the most water is agriculture.

Chapter 7: Managing Non-Renewable Resources Successfully   p. 142-143, 146-157, and p.167 
Mining: p.143, p.146-149, p.154-157

-3 types of minerals; metallic, non-metallic, fossil fuels, examples -p.154
metallic: These minerals are what we know as metals. (Gold, iron, silver, platinum.)
non-metallic: Everything not a metal or fossil fuel. (Asbestos, diamonds, brick, gravel, gypsum, potash, sand, soapstone.)
fossil fuels: Fossil fuels are minerals that release energy when burned. (Coal, natural gas, oil)

-3 types of mines:  open-pit, strip mining, underground -p.156-157
open-pit: - is used to mine minerals that are found near the surface, but that also may extend deep into the ground.
strip mining: is used to mine oil sands, coal, and other minerals that are located in horizontal layers near the surface.
underground: is used to extract mineral ores located deep in the earth.


-Diamonds -p. 160-163,
Indicator mineral: Minerals that are found in the same rocks that diamonds are found in. (Kimberlite)

Role of glaciation: Glaciation moved the indicator material, making kimberlite pipes hard to pinpoint. Also, kimberlite is softer than most Canadian shield minerals, making it easy for the glaciation to erode it compared to surrounding rocks. Meaning most kimberlite pipes are underwater.

Location of diamond mines : Due to most kimberlite pipes being underwater, many of them are in the middle of a lake or pond. They must be located where there would be >0.2 carats of diamond per 100 tonnes of rock.
Most diamond mines are in northern Canada










**Unit 4: Changing Populations (Chapters 10-11, pgs.212-254)**


Terms: 
demography : the composition of a particular human population.


birth rate: The number of births in a population per 1000 people


death rate: The number of deaths in a population per 100 people


doubling time: The amount of time it would take for a country’s population to double


Rule of 70: Doubling time = 70/population growth rate.


immigration rate: The number of immigrants moving to a country in a year per 1000 people. 


emigration rate: the number of emigrants moving out of a country in a year per 1000 people.


net migration rate: The immigration rate minus the emigration rate


population growth rate: Natural increase rate + Net migration rate.


immigrant: A person who leaves country B to go to country A (your country is country A)


emigrant: A person who leaves country A to go to country B


total fertility rate: The average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime


natural increase rate: The birth rate minus the death rate. 


dependency load: The percentage of the population that is non-working. People under 15 and people over 65.



Aging population,  problem & solutions, review: baby boom issues 
An aging population causes a higher dependency load. Build more houses, hospitals.


DTM (Demographic Transition Model – 4 stages)


Pre - transition
-birth and death rates high
-subsistence farming common
-high birth rates because the children could help out on the farm
-population was highly susceptible to disease
-no country in the world is still in this stage
natural increase low


Early Transition
-high birth rates, but lower death rates
-better food storage solutions developed
-sanitation and hygienic facilities implemented
-migration to urban centers
natural increase high


Late Transition
-lower birth and death rates
-an increase agricultural productivity
-machinery introduced
-dropping family sizes
natural increase low


Post-transition
-very low birth and death rates
-4/5ths of the population lives in metropolitan areas
-women in the workforce
-higher levels of immigration required to stabilize
population and repopulate
natural increase very low



Immigration Push and pull factors


Push factors are factors that make you want to move away/not go to a country


Pull factors are factors that make you want to stay/move to another country.


Types of Immigrants – 


Economic Immigrant


skilled worker: Potential skilled workers are judged on a point system, if one member of the family has a high enough point total, the whole family is admitted. 


Skilled trades: Only certain skilled trades are allowed, those that are in need in Canada. They must have a job offer in Canada, have language skills, have 2 years experience in the field, and be qualified by Canadian standards.


Canadian experience: Allows workers who have worked for at least 1 year in Canada before 


Start-up visa: They must want to start a business in Canada. They must show there are approved Canadian investors who will fund their business idea. Must have good language skills, Have at least 1 year of post-secondary education. Must have enough money to support themselves.
Family: Citizens of Canada are allowed to sponsor close family members to come to Canada, the sponsor must be willing to financially support those close family member(s).


Refugee: People who fear cruel or inhumane treatment in their home country as a result of race, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, etc. They can come to Canada.


Where are immigrants coming from? Where do they settle? Immigration peaks, distribution of immigrants
They are coming mostly from Asia, and they also settle in major cities. Canada accepts a particularly high amount of economic immigrants.


Levels of development: developed, newly industrialized, developing countries -characteristics and example countries 


Developing countries have high birth rates with low death rates, causing an unsustainable growth in population. Quality of living will be low.

      In newly industrialized countries, they are making progress towards being developed. Death rates have dropped and population growth decreased.

Developed countries have consistently low birth and death rates, they are well off, the people are living healthy and the country has a healthy economy.


Population density: The amount of people living per km^2


Global Affairs Canada – purpose : Promotes international trade and can support other countries with funds.


Foreign Aid, ODA – What is it? These aids are used to help countries to move through demographic transition as quickly as possible, so the economy will be more sustainable.


NGO – What is it? Examples: A private, not-for-profit organization that works to achieve particular social, environmental, or political goals.



**Unit 5: Liveable Communities (Chapters 12- 14, pgs.255-308)**

Census metropolitan areas (CMAs): multiple municipalities combining to make a larger city.


Dispersed populations: scattered groups of individuals living in a certain area.


linear populations: groups of individuals that live in a line, such as along a highway.


concentrated populations: a large group of individuals all living in the same area.


3Rs (description): Reduce, Reuse Recycle


Examples of Reduce: turn off water while brushing teeth, turn off lights when not in use.


Examples of Reuse: Hand-me-down, Used clothing store, The Beer Store, Second Harvest, Free-cycling, Up-cycling


Examples of Recycle: recycle cardboard, scrap metal. 

Waste Diversion: Diverting waste by recycling and composting


Liveability: all the characteristics of a community that contribute to the quality of life of the people who live there.


Sustainability: improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems.


carrying capacity: the maximum population density of a region.


Liveability factors: environmental quality, crime and safety, education and health provision, access to shops and services, recreational facilities and cultural activities

Measuring sustainability & liveability: 


HDI, Human Development Index
is a summary composite measure of a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health, knowledge and standard of living.

GNH, Gross National Happiness
is a measurement of collective happiness based on economic development.

GDP per capita, Gross Domestic Product per capita
is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (fewer subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, divided by midyear population.

Ecological Footprint (how do you determine it, how do we reduce our footprint), 
the impact of human activities measured in terms of the area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the goods consumed and to assimilate the wastes generated.
In order to reduce one’s ecological footprint, one must transition to a more sustainable and renewable form of energy-related activities.
